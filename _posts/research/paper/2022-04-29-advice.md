# standford deep learning - Lec 8 career advice, Andrew Ng

- 5 ~ 10: basic idea 
- 50 ~ 100 papers: good knowledge about the domain

## Read paper through mutliple passes (not from first to last word)

1. Title, abstract, figure, experiment
2. Intro, conclusion, figure, skim (skip related work because it may used to acknowledge more authors to get paper accepted)
3. Read paper skip math
4. Read whole skip parts does not make sense yet e.g. in le net, some not irrevent anymore

## Questions to ask when read paper:
- What do author try to accomplish?
- Key elements of approach?
- what can you use yourself
- Other references to follow

## Sources of papers

- Twitter
- ML subreddit
- NIPS / ICML / ICIR
- Friends
- arxiv-sanity

## Understand Math

- Rederive from scratch (e.g. art student copy from master then recreate)

2 ~ 3 papers per week instead of cram everything in a few days.
