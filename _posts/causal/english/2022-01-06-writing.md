## Word choice

["Could you please" vs "Could you kindly"](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/53198/could-you-please-vs-could-you-kindly)

> To my British ears, the following phrases have a very slightly haranguing tone (as of a nagging mother):  

    Would you kindly ...  

    Would you please ...    

    Could you kindly ...

    Could you please ...

> Whereas "Please could you..." is straightforward, conventional, polite and ubiquitous.
