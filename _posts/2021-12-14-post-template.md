excerpt: Reminder for myself on the posting format
---

This is for myself:
* Title case for tags & category
* Add intro for every post for meta preview section. (first 50 words)
* backup chinese version before replace for config files due to some may override the langauge setting
* For the file that applies to both langauge version e.g. the Jekyll customerisation, markdown cheatsheet post & this file, just maintain one since it is easy to modify file the wrong file with the same name.
* Header image - [resizer](https://promo.com/tools/image-resizer/), since header image will be strech, it's either crop the middle section to maintain aspect ratio or manually tune the size (900 * 400 is ok)
