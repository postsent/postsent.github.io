This is for myself:
* Add intro for every post for meta preview section. (first 50 words)
* change local file when pushed where "# myurl" to the github url instead of the localhost url which is for the local testing.
* backup chinese version before replace for config files due to some may override the langauge setting
* For the file that applies to both langauge version e.g. the Jekyll customerisation, markdown cheatsheet post & this file, just maintain one since it is easy to modify file the wrong file with the same name.
* 
TODO:

- [ ] Add collapsible for long code snippet.
