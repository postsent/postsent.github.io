# Google calendar

Usage: TODO task within a week

# Google tasks

MS TODO is initally set for longer period task, however, I primarily use google calendar, switching platform is not convenitent and easy to forget based on my personal experience.
Taskboard chrome extension gives a better UI. And Google Task can be accessed directly from the calendar via the right sidebar and everything is integrated into one platform makes it easier to remember and operates on.

Apple calendar is ok but across platform support is not ideal.

# Paper note vs digital
