We choose to do the chatbot project (only 3 teams choose it among 100+).
It involves: Dialogflow, web scraper, ML, platform integration(Facebook messenger + Discord) + frontend(react, typescript, etc).  
APIs: Google map, infermedica(medical diagonsis), News, Receipes (data to feed the recommendation system)  
Database: Mongodb.  
Dialogflow intent-based handler passes message from frontend to backend and vice versa, which allows us to unplug the frontend and integrate other platform easier.  
Facebook and Discord integration shares the same output format - plain text. Thou there are built-in API to display them nicer.
Messenger involves webhook but Discord doesn't.  

Side notes:  
The error message for duplicate name in setting up Facebook page is really bad. It said "Invalid page name" rather than duplicate page name. After 5 consecutive tries to realise this, Facebook regards me as a spam user and block me for 1 hr-ish.
