**Disclaimer:** Below are based on 2021, pls references to the latest school website for accurate info.

# Background

I am in CS degree majoring in AI.
Except for COMP4418 - the logic reasoning (prolog) course, COMP9313 (Big data mangement) & COMP9318 (Data Warehousing and Data Mining). I think I finish all the AI related courses in our uni (except those whose code begins with "MATH" since they are more for the math student)

Surprisingly, our school does not have NLP courses.

Summary to the study notes will be in separate posts.

# Notes

If no details on the exam are mentioned, then the standard exam format applies (exam after 19T3 all online).

ENGG2600 description below is more general due to IP.

For those courses *average 100 slides per week*
- Means you need to learn selectively, cover all points but with a focus on what's important.
Check the corresonding scholl website for the weekly course outline.

# 19T3

## COMP1511 Programming Fundamentals 

Learn the pogramming basic in C, pls revisit double linked list for the final (thou it may not be a full example in the lab)  

CSESoc has plenty of resources, highly recommended, I recall there is a flowchart on how all COMP courses are related (Big shout out to the person did it). The CSE learning has a youtube channel discussing vscode, Vlab, winscp, etc way to connect to the school server and modify the files.
I personally use vscode, Vlab and winscp. I recall they stress in the early stage of programming, it is important to foster some good habits before being exposes to those convenitent vscode extensions. I personally think thou, efficiency is more important.  

## COMP1131 Mathematics 1A 

Standard Universal First Year MATH with pen and paper. Fav thing is the $2 folder (for paper with holes?) bought from the Quad, the shop opposite the school chemist shop, everything taking good notes and put it in feels like collecting stamps back in the days  

MathSoc (Huge shout out to Gerald Huang), similar to CSESoc, for the early year work, gives plenty of resources, past solution on quizes, etc.

## MATH1081 Discrete Mathematics 
It turns out to be the MATH class that I went to in person consultation (4th floors in the math building if recalled) the most. The complex tute problems are quite interesting with great implication with real-life problems but the foundation is extremely important too. 


# 20T1

Notes, after this term, almost all my classes go online...
The grading system, as a result of COVID, becomes Satisfactory > 50 and unsatisfactory which does not count towards to WAM.

## MATH1231 Mathematics 1B  

1131 continue.

## COMP1531 Software Engineering Fundamentals   

Hayden taught this course. First team project course. The project is about a chat platform with frontend ready and backend leaves for us to implemented. Flask, Python, in-file database + global variable are used.

## COMP2521 Data Structures and Algorithms   

Standard general data structure course.

# 20T2

## COMP2511 Object-Oriented Design and Programming  

Standard universal OOP course in Java. Use javafx to write a dungeon game. Main focus on design patterns. 
Patterns: Factory, builder, singleton, visitor, template, decorator, adaptor, iterator, observer, composite, strategy, state. OO principles, design by contract, code smell, generic type.

> :gem: **Suggestions**: **Practise** coding on each design  with small example.

## COMP1521 Computer Systems Fundamentals   

Taught in MIPS, low level. Register, threads, process, floating points, bit operator, binary, hex, dec conversion, file system, directory, virtual memory, concurrency. C to MIPS and vice versa.

## DATA1001 Introduction to Data Science and Decisions 

It is composed of three componenets - basic SQL, basic stats & basic modelling analysis.
SQL - Key attribute, foregin key, integrity constraints, insertion, violation of contraints. Basic query syntax(SELECT, AVG, etc) on insertion, deletion, update.  Data type. 
Probabilty - R basic. Precion, bias, OLS.
Modelling - price model, ML vs Econometrics, nowcast, hypothesis.

# 20T3
	
## COMP3311 Database Systems   

Standard database course. SQLite, Postgresql, Python library for postgresql.

## COMP3331 Computer Networks and Applications  

Standard Network course.

## COMP3431 Robotic Software Architecture  

Taught ROS1 (Python2). The architecture is a pub/sub pattern that allows TCP/IP connection between different robot sensors and other device such as your laptop. VM (Ubuntu) is needed for the ROS environment thou WSL2 can be used. 
First assignment is on simple wall follower that follow one sides of the wall and we need to detect marker (QR code) and mark them on the Rviz (visualisation tool) as well as mapping (Gmapping).

Second is the project as below demo. Simulated Mini Autonomous driving. Two main sections - the detection on colored poles (traffic light), stop sign, intersection, T-intersection, human and other robots. Then the lane following part. We modified/twisted an existing lane following ROS package from the 2020 turtlebot competition. Then, I added extra: manully drive the robot accros whole arena, store every 5 second a point. Then we can do a bfs on these aggregated points to achive something like a GPS. There are a lot of potentials in terms of how to improve this mini driving stimulation.

No final, two project, two report, one small one large all involved real robot interaction.
Due to COVID, thou our group has four memebers, we need to choose two to come every week and then rotate. Then, since two is for detection, and we realised later the team interacted with the robot needs more time, we sometimes just let them send the screenshot from the robot camera and me and another member do it at home.

The funny moment is that, in the last few practices, Prof Claud, kindly asked us how many of us will come, not many teams response and ended up having 20-ish students in a room, which back in 2020 T3, is emm not ideal. Thanks Prof for being extremely supportive as this course along with another fews, is the handful number of courses that has in-person tute during that strange lockdown period.
This in-person robot interaction during the lockdown period, definitely one of the best memory at uni.

## ECON1101 Microeconomics 1 

Before I saw a lot of memes on the playecnomic game, after taking this course, finally understand it. Btw, based on my scapter on the classutil website, this course is the most taken for many years.
So how is the game u probably wonder? A lot of room for improvement. Not recommend spending much time, just starts early, make a simple strategy and then get over it.
The online format of the course thou, is the most well-structured among all the courses I took. 
<p align="center">

</p>


## ECON1203 Business and Economic Statistics   
Foundation of the foundation of stats.
Detailed focus in variances, expectation, regression, etc. (formulae)

# 21T1


## COMP3411 Artificial Intelligence   
Language used: Prolog. Thou it does make sense to have a taste on logic programming, 3 year CS degree + trimester, in my view, gives insufficient programming expereince relative to other uni globally. Relative to other courses, it is not as practical. Hear that summer term is taught in Python, bit jealous.

## COMP9417 Machine Learning & Data Mining average 100 slides per week  
## COMP9517 Computer Vision   
## ENGG2600 Social AI   

Decide on project plan, competition to participate, groups between the team memebers. Set up meeting minutes, decide on weekly meeting time, schdule meeting within the team I am in. Discuss on the objective of the course, get to know each other in the team, decide the role within the sub team and the whole team. Explore potential robot competition, research on existing SOTA solution and improvement. 
Familarise with ROS1 (not version 2 since the competition use version1:< ), start ROS programming, setup VM for ROS environment. Document , communicate everything using a series of tools inside Microsoft "Family Bucket".
Following the course outline, logbook for individual contribution, organise code with GitLab.
Reflection and peer review at the end of every term.

# 21T2

## MATH2801 Stats     
## COMP3121 Algorithms & Programming Tech   
## COMP9444 Neural Networks, Deep Learning   
## ENGG2600 Social AI 

Begin more ROS programming via a series ROS tutorials online. Re-organise the team with the focus on multi-robot exploration and victim detection. Finalise a basic implementation at the end of term.

# 21T3

## COMP3900 Computer Science Project     

We choose to do the chatbot project (only 3 teams choose it among 100+).
Architecture diagram as below

Dialogflow intent-based handler passes message from frontend to backend and vice versa, which allows us to unplug the frontend and integrate other platform easier.  
Facebook and Discord integration shares the same output format - plain text. Thou there are built-in API to display them nicer.
Messenger involves webhook but Discord doesn't.  

Side notes:  
The error message for duplicate name in setting up Facebook page is really bad. It said "Invalid page name" rather than duplicate page name. After 5 consecutive tries to realise this, Facebook regards me as a spam user and block me for 1 hr-ish. After some interaction with Facebook API, realise they have done quite some to ensure privacy e.g. can setup some serious privacy protocoal for the Facebook page using some recognised app to define the term of use.

## COMP4920 Professional Issues and Ethics 

We were taught about:
* different ethic theory with a focus on Kant(duty/Deontologist) and Mill(Consequence/Teleologist)
* IP, copy right, etc
* Real-life application of ethics problem and theory
Interestingly have been write for ages until this course. Nice to practise a bit writing skill again.

> :gem:**Tips**: Choose a tutor who is not having too many tutorials, otherwise, they cannot communicate with so many students well. Be acitive in tute. Starts writing early. UNSW smartThinking - provides nice feedback for writing assginment

## COMP9418 Probabilistic Graphical Model   

Bayes net, different Markov model(HMM), dynamic Bayes Net. Sampling techniques.
A good balance between theory and coding.

> :gem:**Tips**: Familar with the concept and the lab weekly on time, take good notes as always.

## ENGG2600  Social AI/AI 4 everyone   

This term, we continue the coding for the automonous exploration package. Then, integrate it with the computer vision part. 
We meet the basic of the expected result which is three robots' automonous exploration given an unknown map, then mapping, victim detection, API controling individual robot during the exploration. E.g. Let the robot move closer to the victim if detected but with a lower confidence.
Finsih scripts & videos for the competition (Did not get into top three, but our animated style like Jaiden Animation which I believe is the best, others are more informative and "conventional - ppt style"). Arc creative provides feedback for the animation and the script.
The youtube playlist is not yet public, below are some slides of our videos.
Final assessment mainly based on the GitLab with others documentation tool taking into account.
We did aggregate everything into the GitLab including all important documention and summary of the progress for the whole year.

Last note, without this course, I won't be finish the degree early unless I takes 4 this term (thou I did spend a considerable amount of time still in this course). In this course, during this COVID, having these lovely teammate and "Instructor/Prof/Dr/Lecturer" who will be with you for a year, I personally think is the best way to conclude my bacholer degree. Huge thanks to everyone in the team.
