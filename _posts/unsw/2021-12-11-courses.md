|COMP1511 Programming Fundamentals| Learn the pogramming basic in C, pls revisit double linked list for the final (thou it may not be a full example in the lab) |  
|COMP1131 Mathematics 1A| Standard Universal First Year MATH with pen and paper. Fav thing is the $2 folder (for paper with holes?) bought from the Quad, the shop opposite the school chemist shop, everything taking good notes and put it in feels like collecting stamps back in the days|  
|MATH1081 Discrete Mathematics| It turns out to be the MATH class that I went to in person consultation (4th floors in the math building if recalled) the most. The complex ones are really interesting with great implication with real-life problems but the foundation is extremely important too.| 

As the only term that is in-person during my Bacholr degree (luckily have an extra year with UNSW during Foundation year/Year12).
Recall: Prof Richard Buckland, before I began my uni studies, I, at 2019, watched his youtube videos about intro of programming(COMP1917 back then) that is published 10 years ago. That time, his hair is still less gray until I met him in person twice in COMP1511 and MATH1081 where our Lecurer Marc Chee and Daniel received their best teacher award by students. What's funny is that: Both Marc and Daniel told us that they were  student of Richard back in those days when he is a lecturer. One example I still recall one is his talks about testing. He made an analogy that instead of firing a cannonball with high precision that takes a lot of time towards the warship (the bugs), u can fire multiple times.
The 1081 tutor mentioned that we were so luck since he has been teaching for a while still havent see him in person since he is known to be busy.
