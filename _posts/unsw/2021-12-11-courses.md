# Notes
ENGG2600 description below is more general due to IP.
For those courses *average 100 slides per week*
- Means you need to learn selectively, cover all points but with a focus on what's important.

# 19T3

## COMP1511 Programming Fundamentals 
Learn the pogramming basic in C, pls revisit double linked list for the final (thou it may not be a full example in the lab)  

## COMP1131 Mathematics 1A 
Standard Universal First Year MATH with pen and paper. Fav thing is the $2 folder (for paper with holes?) bought from the Quad, the shop opposite the school chemist shop, everything taking good notes and put it in feels like collecting stamps back in the days  

## MATH1081 Discrete Mathematics 
It turns out to be the MATH class that I went to in person consultation (4th floors in the math building if recalled) the most. The complex ones are really interesting with great implication with real-life problems but the foundation is extremely important too. 


# 20T1

## COMP2511 Object-Oriented Design and Programming   
## MATH1231 Mathematics 1B   
## COMP1531 Software Engineering Fundamentals   

# 20T2

## COMP2521 Data Structures and Algorithms   
## COMP1521 Computer Systems Fundamentals   
## DATA1001 Introduction to Data Science and Decisions average 100 slides per week  

# 20T3
	
## COMP3311 Database Systems   
## COMP3331 Computer Networks and Applications  
## COMP3431 Robotic Software Architecture  

# 21T0

## ECON1101 Microeconomics 1   
## ECON1203 Business and Economic Statistics   

# 21T1


## COMP3411 Artificial Intelligence   
## COMP9417 Machine Learning & Data Mining average 100 slides per week  
## COMP9517 Computer Vision   
## ENGG2600 Social AI   

Decide on project plan, competition to participate, groups between the team memebers. Set up meeting minutes, decide on weekly meeting time, schdule meeting within the team I am in. Discuss on the objective of the course, get to know each other in the team, decide the role within the sub team and the whole team. Explore potential robot competition, research on existing SOTA solution and improvement. 
Familarise with ROS1 (not version 2 since the competition use version1:< ), start ROS programming, setup VM for ROS environment. Document , communicate everything using a series of tools inside Microsoft "Family Bucket".
Following the course outline, logbook for individual contribution, organise code with GitLab.
Reflection and peer review at the end of every term.
# 21T2


## MATH2801 Stats     
## COMP3121 Algorithms & Programming Tech   
## COMP9444 Neural Networks, Deep Learning   
## ENGG2600 Social AI 

Begin more ROS programming via a series ROS tutorials online. Re-organise the team with the focus on multi-robot exploration and victim detection. Finalise a basic implementation at the end of term.

# 21T3



## COMP3900 Computer Science Project     
## COMP4920 Professional Issues and Ethics UNSW smartThinking - provides nice feedback for writing assginment   
## COMP9418 Probabilistic Graphical Model   
## ENGG2600  Social AI/AI 4 everyone   

This term, we continue the coding for the automonous exploration package. Then, integrate it with the computer vision part. 
We meet the basic of the expected result which is three robots' automonous exploration given an unknown map, then mapping, victim detection, API controling individual robot during the exploration. E.g. Let the robot move closer to the victim if detected but with a lower confidence.
Finsih scripts & videos for the competition (Did not get into top three, but our animated style like Jaiden Animation which I believe is the best, others are more informative and "conventional - ppt style"). Arc creative provides feedback for the animation and the script.
The youtube playlist is not yet public, below are some slides of our videos.
Final assessment mainly based on the GitLab with others documentation tool taking into account.
We did aggregate everything into the GitLab including all important documention and summary of the progress for the whole year.

Last note, without this course, I won't be finish the degree early unless I takes 4 this term (thou I did spend a considerable amount of time still in this course). In this course, during this COVID, having these lovely teammate and "Instructor/Prof/Dr/Lecturer" who will be with you for a year, I personally think is the best way to conclude my bacholer degree. Huge thanks to everyone in the team.
