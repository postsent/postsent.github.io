# What is DL

**"Deep learning" 2015, Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio & Geoffrey Hinton**

> Ultimately, major progress in artificial intelligence will come about
through systems that combine **representation learning with complex
reasoning**. Although deep learning and simple reasoning have been
used for speech and handwriting recognition for a long time, new
paradigms are needed to **replace rule-based** manipulation of **symbolic**
expressions by operations on large **vectors**
