# Note taking

Summarary with TOC and great indexing, then summary of summary. The summary should be print-friendly (E.g. OneNote is not good here).

## Formatting
Format the note later, understanding first. E.g. After summerising the all lec slides into word doc, then starts format them together.

If multiple headings contain same word   
e.g. problem 1: abc problem 2: edf, then I choose to use below to save space in TOC.
```
--problem--
abc
edf
```
