# Overwrite 

2022.4.29

- All theory from lab should be summariesd in OneNote





## other


Summarary with TOC and great indexing, then summary of summary. The summary should be print-friendly (E.g. OneNote is not good here).

## Formatting
Format the note later, understanding first. E.g. After summerising the all lec slides into word doc, then starts format them together.

If multiple headings contain same word   
e.g. problem 1: abc problem 2: edf, then I choose to use below to save space in TOC.
```
--problem--
abc
edf
```

## Apps

### Word doc

For print out needed content e.g. memorise summarised lec slides for the exam.

### OneNote

For content requires good indexing but less memorising part.

Tut/theories will be put on Onenote via tablet written, no paper.
Coding/prac summeried as jupyter notebook.

Samsung note for tablet , but 

## Coding

Use educated print statement if dont know

## Paper note vs digital

索引，搜索

## Web

### Weava highlighter

# Mind map vs list view

Mind map, by my experiment is more suitable for < 100 nodes whereas list is more useful for e.g. 1k+ rows;

# Organise folder

An great example is when I organise my coursework, I initally collect by weeks; but i realise sometiems i dont know wherethe note belongs to and have to click multiple folders to get the desire lec; Now, I choose to collect them based on the e.g. file type i.e. all lec slides/lab sheet/tut belongs to a folder .its all about creating efficient and effective indexing
