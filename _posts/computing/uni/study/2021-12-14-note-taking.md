Summarary with TOC and great indexing, then summary of summary. The summary should be print-friendly (E.g. OneNote is not good here).

# Formatting
Format the note later, understanding first. E.g. After summerising the all lec slides into word doc, then starts format them together.

If multiple headings contain same word   
e.g. problem 1: abc problem 2: edf, then I choose to use below to save space in TOC.
```
--problem--
abc
edf
```

# Apps

Samsung note for tablet , but 

# Google calendar

Usage: TODO task within a week

# Google tasks

<figcaption align="center">Task, subtask</figcaption>

MS TODO is initally set for longer period task, however, I primarily use google calendar, switching platform is not convenitent and easy to forget based on my personal experience.
Taskboard chrome extension gives a better UI. And Google Task can be accessed directly from the calendar via the right sidebar and everything is integrated into one platform makes it easier to remember and operates on.

Apple calendar is ok but across platform support is not ideal.
