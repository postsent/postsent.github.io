New year, seeing many 2022 Resolution, one by Yahn Lechun, is: "My 2022 resolution is 4k 2048*3100" something like this..
Genuinely surprised Elon Mask being interviewed by Lex for 3 hr-ish. Effort.

Should have made this Github blog page early, its actually a plan for Dec~Jan 2021.

USYD Enrolment can check prereq :cry:

I initially was thinking if I want to open source this github page, (I have created a public separate github comment page to sortof achieve this, private repo, public comment using e.g. gisus).
But everything I learn is from the open communnity - there isnt a reason I should worry about it given so many great examples available online already.

Once 2 steps verification is on, complexity of password seems to be less important.

Multiple browsers for different purpose is good, but on laptop, it "rams" up quite quick.

Determinginf factor of buying a product: Brand -> Price -> Comments

That time of the year again, CES 2022 (Consumer Electronics Show)

Recall in 2019, Dr Li Feifei was Dr, but already gave lots of contribution to the field, then 2020 in the lec slides, it becomes Professor.

Received the Batch first public mail of the year, insightful.  

Github Page Updates can be frequent, otherwise, a big update will refresh slow.  

Try to add some details to intermediate git commit: from "updates" -> "updates: tensorflow design"  

Things happen, the first reaction should always be "how to solve it" rather git blame. Consequentialism.  

Sadly, looks like quite some blog page ending up no new post anymore after years, hope mine will continue bit longer.  

My 2022 resolution: Family, health, study. Efficiency.  

Having a blog enables a sharable learning expereince rather than me putting all the notes in OneNote with less potential interaction.  

**2022-01-07  **

[Leetcode for data science? reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/lkn4rl/please_stop_asking_data_scientists_about_leetcode/) so temporary discontinue.  

Realise have learnt a ton but didnt absorbed so well.  

The design in database of single table vs multiple to delegate different responsiblity also applies to note taking. The pros and cons are similar as well. Recall one primary reason I make multiple pages in OneNote for lec summary is that I have once accidentally change a section which I dont know where in a page with huge chunk of notes, ever since, I prefer multiple pages.

Realise ``alt + shift + i`` can insert two trailing spaces for all lines.  

Enjoy word with many syllables. Just sounds good, e.g. miscellaneous.  

Recall: Once in a group meeting, I translate a chineses meme quote into english, it goes   
"Ur voice are so lovely that my ears feel pregnant".

Realise if being too cautious i.e. think about all possible cases, often lead to more worry/stress, and this may pass on to others which is not good.  

Recall: My English name is given by my primary school teacher (I highly sus its because Tom & Jerry), could have change, but looking back, memory.

Do things at real time instead of stacks it at the end.

A joke: after study & continue studying computer stuffs, realise eyes are perhaps the most important organ, and mine arent too bad relatively.

Understanding is about the ability to rephrase the speaker's quote and being agreed by them.

Information is always been updated, so the latest possible the better.

Huge fan of standing if possible and elinates chances of non-standing programming/latopping. Standing should be the trend over sitting or whatever others.

I found imagine ur vision as a computer and render image segmentation on ur vision by imagination could eliminate some noise in real life since moving part of the attention to something else i.e. the surrounding environment.

Thou being in Aus for quite a while, after doing the Jigsaw-comments kaggle competition, I learnt a lot more new words...

In practise, graph EDA is not so needed unless to show someone else, e.g. class balance problem can be shown by plain text, why? The notebook loads faster...

Filename, comments should be named such that after 1 year, u still can quickly get the point, why so? Learn from a mistake where after 1 year, the project seems to be written by someone else, sort of.

use \#ref to locate the reference - Index better.

I am tired for some reason, then I drink some water and open two windows -> I am back. Fresh air - underrated.

Looking back, chasing infinite subject is always much tastier than finite human rule based stuff e.g. chess.

When search a terminology, other relevant helpful info may pop up, just save the links, dont get distracted until later. Think this process should be like a "guided/destination-oriented DFS". Other relveant part will be back tracked once the original aim is achiveved.

**2022-01-10**

First tennis play of the year. Exercise, for computer learner, is more like "eye-rcise".

Did not expect google translate being so good, looks like I can just focus on maintaining one langauge version of the blog.

I sort of have a better understanding on how to find ur interest: u think of it without hesitation when u go to bed,  wake up, and forget dining since it is more tastier, mentally.

To ***summerise*** a coding exericse, convert useful part to a class with good taste, desgin & comments.

\#interesting Saw a research paper saying: The prettier the plot is, the more convincing the result is. And the comment obviously are: finally I have a reason why my graph is ugly, becuase it is real...

Realise enjoy the way coursera delivers its content, having the reading section right after the videos allows us to focus on understanding during the video and takes note afterwards, noice.

\#TODO

Kaggle competition is like a random grid search for the optimal solution to a real world probelm

Kind of confused to what extent / permission u can reuse / reproduce the coursera material https://github.com/ibrahimjelliti/Deeplearning.ai-Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization

After join the coursera discourse, find this:

[strange: a standford student post a lot course materials..](https://aman.ai/) probably permission granted.

Find that the study notes is rather subjective and works well for only the person who write it since it is logic in his/her POV. I guess that is one reason why study note on existing course material does not infringe copyright to some extent.

- RNN pytorch tutorial sentiment analysis
- Abhishek Thakur youtube on ML kaggle pipeline
- Custom model 
- Add dedicated page without any page meta and link it with the category based archieve page e.g. a link shown before the excerpt.
  
The ability to hold back a subject of great interest e.g. summarise code into class with taste for the sake of efficiency - coursera 7 day free trial, is something.

  - sitemap, cname for this blog maybe?
  - relevant math e.g. common distribution formula cheatsheet
  
\#Ask unsupervised learning for these relationship modelling word embedding right, not human label right?

Photos is perfect invention to capture memory, but we live in the present, sometimes, ppl so much into take a pic for something special e.g. the northern light, and after it gone, realise they did not give enough time to enjoy and appreciate it. See in person vs from recorded videos, that's what present special. Sort of similar to: taking over amount of notes during the lec and forget to understand it, which is the whole purpose.

Think when standford open a new AI course, it is the standard or one of the. Others just rephrase with their understanding, rather a review/slight improvement of a existing standard, which makes sense.

POV: enjoy UNSW timetable allocation more than USYD. Just more initutively + with filters like before noon, after, etc.

Learning a new language, the main adv is access to a new community, English, obviously, is currently the largest one.

Given in the [coursera honor code](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code?language=en_US), it mentions that should not share solution, and that lec slides type could be shared for non-commerical purpose with references, I suppose I could post the concept with no solution.

Specialisation in Coursera means a set of courses.

When self-study, important to focus on what's important / needed. Skip read those not helpful.

Sometimes, I feel like, I dont need more time, but efficiency by which, focus on important relevant, up-to-updated info than being 'distracted' by other not-so-important info along the research way.

\#interesting A news mentioned that a country has a hospitalisation rate of 50:50 for those who vaccined and not. The comment section then says wouldnt that mean vac is not working? The pre-condition that is forgot is that that country (forget which) has 90% population vac compared to 10% of those who dont. So, in this rate, it should be 9 times less possible to get hospitalised compared to those unvaccined.

Seek clarification immediately to save time, result, in real practise always more important.

wait, win11 now support different background images for different virtual desktop.

win11 file explorer is so lagging, however, when u download files online to local machine, the pop up window asking for location is using win10 file explorer which is way faster.

It appears to me that window sortof less interested in win10 and put all feedback requierment into win11.
E.g. Onenote in win11 is much better than the win10 ones.

Finish up transfer files from the old pc to this one, as expected, 1.5 days.

The R9000k looks really nice in terms of the specs, the RGB lighting around the chassis, the high refresh, different gaming-ish design is too much extra for me and make me decide this 16p instead. Based on some reviews currently available RTX3080 laptop performance is 10%+ better than the 3070 but the prices go up drastically which is commented as not a worthy upgrade unless need more juice.

When back up files, double check on validity of the file. E.g. when backup old ipad2 files to pc, I found that due to the existance of some ystem files, the following up video files are damaged during the copy, and fortunity I manually fixed all the invalid ones before I factory reset the ipad.

back up files from ipad2 to pc, after double fact check, found 100-ish photos were missing, google a bit, from using itunes for backuping, then realise those photos are clouded ones so can chill now.

just need: a quiet, has printscreen, home, end, page up/down keyboard, big screen with small bezel (no logo in front screen = perfect).
Powerful CPU, NVIDIA GPU (or if inte;/AMD ones have support for pytorch), ok battery life, reasonably portable (weight), price mid-mid high tier if for student.
