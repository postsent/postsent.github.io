Currently are still familar with the Jekyll (different metas) and tries to customerise something, the process of keeping two version of posts is kindof taking some time.  
Just realise could have update the gitignore and then keep on copy instead of one for remote one for local...

Realise the internet condition in China is different and need extra care. Set up CDN is not considered yet as it requires to buy a custom domain name.

New year, seeing many 2022 Resolution, one by Yahn Lechun, is: "My 2022 resolution is 4k 2048*3100" something like this..
Genuinely surprised Elon Mask being interviewed by Lex for 3 hr-ish. Effort.

Should have made this Github blog page early, its actually a plan for Dec~Jan 2021.

USYD Enrolment can check prereq :cry:

I initially was thinking if I want to open source this github page, (I have created a public separate github comment page to sortof achieve this, private repo, public comment using e.g. gisus).
But everything I learn is from the open communnity - there isnt a reason I should worry about it given so many great examples available online already.

[CEO Pfizer ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_LhPMhkEdw&ab_channel=LexFridman)
[Amazon deepracer](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/) looks fun.

Learn the hierachy of my home country, always more to learn.

Use below tag, if nothing else is on, I will choose some to write.

Once 2 steps verification is on, complexity of password seems to be less important.

Multiple browsers for different purpose is good, but on laptop, it "rams" up quite quick.

Determinginf factor of buying a product: Brand -> Price -> Comments

That time of the year again, CES 2022 (Consumer Electronics Show)

Recall in 2019, Dr Li Feifei was Dr, but already gave lots of contribution to the field, then 2020 in the lec slides, it becomes Professor.

Received the Batch first public mail of the year, insightful.  

Github Page Updates can be frequent, otherwise, a big update will refresh slow.  

Try to add some details to intermediate git commit: from "updates" -> "updates: tensorflow design"  

Things happen, the first reaction should always be "how to solve it" rather git blame. Consequentialism.  

Sadly, looks like quite some blog page ending up no new post anymore after years, hope mine will continue bit longer.  

My 2022 resolution: Family, health, study. Efficiency.  

Having a blog enables a sharable learning expereince rather than me putting all the notes in OneNote with less potential interaction.  

**2022-01-07  **

[Leetcode for data science? reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/lkn4rl/please_stop_asking_data_scientists_about_leetcode/) so temporary discontinue.  

Realise have learnt a ton but didnt absorbed so well.  

The design in database of single table vs multiple to delegate different responsiblity also applies to note taking. The pros and cons are similar as well. Recall one primary reason I make multiple pages in OneNote for lec summary is that I have once accidentally change a section which I dont know where in a page with huge chunk of notes, ever since, I prefer multiple pages.

Realise ``alt + shift + i`` can insert two trailing spaces for all lines.  

Enjoy word with many syllables. Just sounds good, e.g. miscellaneous.  

Recall: Once in a group meeting, I translate a chineses meme quote into english, it goes   
"Ur voice are so lovely that my ears feel pregnant".

Realise if being too cautious i.e. think about all possible cases, often lead to more worry/stress, and this may pass on to others which is not good.  

Recall: My English name is given by my primary school teacher (I highly sus its because Tom & Jerry), could have change, but looking back, memory.

[CDC Vaccine cross ages](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult.html)

Do things at real time instead of stacks it at the end.

A joke: after study & continue studying computer stuffs, realise eyes are perhaps the most important organ, and mine arent too bad relatively.

Understanding is about the ability to rephrase the speaker's quote and being agreed by them.

Information is always been updated, so the latest possible the better.

Huge fan of standing if possible and elinates chances of non-standing programming/latopping. Standing should be the trend over sitting or whatever others.

I found imagine ur vision as a computer and render image segmentation on ur vision by imagination could eliminate some noise in real life since moving part of the attention to something else i.e. the surrounding environment.

Thou being in Aus for quite a while, after doing the Jigsaw-comments kaggle competition, I learnt a lot more new words...

In practise, graph EDA is not so needed unless to show someone else, e.g. class balance problem can be shown by plain text, why? The notebook loads faster...

Filename, comments should be named such that after 1 year, u still can quickly get the point, why so? Learn from a mistake where after 1 year, the project seems to be written by someone else, sort of.

use \#ref to locate the reference - Index better.

I am tired for some reason, then I drink some water and open two windows -> I am back. Fresh air - underrated.

Looking back, chasing infinite subject is always much tastier than finite human rule based stuff e.g. chess.

When search a terminology, other relevant helpful info may pop up, just save the links, dont get distracted until later. Think this process should be like a "guided/destination-oriented DFS". Other relveant part will be back tracked once the original aim is achiveved.

\#Ideas Dronedense, believe many like me used to have similar ideas.

Planned economy, market-driven economy - hierachy vs share.

\#LifeHack one side adhesive tape will leave marks on high-temperature-resistance dinning table. Solution? Put some Alcohol

Saw Joma youtube channel saying something like "My desktop setting has blah, blah,... it is perrrfect, and the only thing this setup lacks is my talent"

\#TODO Email management e.g. create rules, organise file system , password management.

[pdf to word doc](https://www.adobe.com/sg/acrobat/online/pdf-to-word.html#:~:text=Microsoft%20Word%20document%3A-,Click%20the%20Select%20a%20file%20button%20above%2C%20or%20drag%20and,sign%20in%20to%20share%20it.)

Recall: "Learn how to learn, and u will never 'ask' "

Tbh, I am off my Ipad recently, I found that I am slightly more productive -> less Youtube Algorithm..

**2022-01-10**

First tennis play of the year. Exercise, for computer learner, is more like "eye-rcise".

Did not expect google translate being so good, looks like I can just focus on maintaining one langauge version of the blog.

I sort of have a better understanding on how to find ur interest: u think of it without hesitation when u go to bed,  wake up, and forget dining since it is more tastier, mentally.

\#cs log4j bug.

Strange when I search the copyright of material on coursera, no direct answer pop up, I guess it is just common sense.

\#TODO static methods pythonic way [ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30556857/creating-a-static-class-with-no-instances/30557075)

Always nice to see perspective from other country.

> Understanding the data is responsible for 80% of the success or failure in data science projects.

Looks like everytime is almost the same, thou havent play and properly exercise for a while, can not resist to play hard during the first tennis match knowing that it will hurt the next day.

To ***summerise*** a coding exericse, convert useful part to a class with good taste, desgin & comments.

\#interesting Saw a research paper saying: The prettier the plot is, the more convincing the result is. And the comment obviously are: finally I have a reason why my graph is ugly, becuase it is real...

Realise enjoy the way coursera delivers its content, having the reading section right after the videos allows us to focus on understanding during the video and takes note afterwards, noice.

The last man standing cross all subjects - Math.

\#TODO 
- dict.get()
- dict correspond to hash table

Kaggle competition is like a random grid search for the optimal solution to a real world probelm

Feel like python is just a wrappe around all other domain-specific langauge, python to call the api and other langauge to implement the algo efficiently.

Github page Blog could serve like a perosnalised dictaionary of stuffs learnt.

Kind of confused to what extent / permission u can reuse / reproduce the coursera material https://github.com/ibrahimjelliti/Deeplearning.ai-Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization

**2022-01-12**

After join the coursera discourse, find this:
[nice discussion on coursera copyirght issue](https://community.deeplearning.ai/t/assert-consequence-of-breaking-honor-code-none/53573)

[strange: a standford student post a lot course materials..](https://aman.ai/) probably permission granted.

Find that the study notes is rather subjective and works well for only the person who write it since it is logic in his/her POV. I guess that is one reason why study note on existing course material does not infringe copyright to some extent.

[copyright of course slides](https://community.deeplearning.ai/t/week-1-course-slide/11412/3)

coursera is really geneously - allow video download

\#TODO 

- python tricks / good code taste
- put lab prac into a class demonstrate understanding.
- RNN pytorch tutorial sentiment analysis
- Abhishek Thakur youtube on ML kaggle pipeline
- Custom model 
- Add dedicated page without any page meta and link it with the category based archieve page e.g. a link shown before the excerpt.
  
The ability to hold back a subject of great interest e.g. summarise code into class with taste for the sake of efficiency - coursera 7 day free trial, is something.

not looking good: https://www.sydney.edu.au/covid-19/latest-updates.html

If u think of urself as a ML model, then all life experience is part of the training set that u "should" learn and generalise.

\#Dumb Myself and my mum were having this oven with poor timer where u cannot set exact time. And I think of using a paper and mark it and this and that, and after a week, realise we could just use our phone to time it, strange, really strange.
