Finish listen to Lex with LeCun interview. Learning.

Jeff hinton used to have a title of "engineering fellow" in google. That's all.

Mindmap with different templates - make taking notes, review more interesting and also give the highest efficiency to recall past knowledge 
what not? TOC style of bullets point with indentation, personal experience is less effective compared to mind map, each branch reduce to time taken by a factor of that branch number.

All, if not, most are just feelings of different kinds, so should be all controlable or better take advantage of. Productivity & health here would be the evalution metric.

Knowledge is prob a keyword base mapping, topology (casual relation) over geometric (acutal distance measure) as one says.

Emm, they all at least been to Canada... Big 3.

\#improve
- Effort is enough, but sometimes the right window of time is also. E.g. I did the SWOT analysis on the wrong aspect, turns out a similar analysis is published after the tut which help confirms my understanding more.
- change lofi to mind wave song, consistent non-monotonic help aovid shift in focus.
- outside view e.g. nice sun can also be distraction, sometimes, a confined room is a booster for productivity.
- smarter not harder. Tiem out for each task.

Taking note using mindmap is like learning by extract structural repreesntation from the unstructure ones lec slide, recording, etc.

We may be just a more advanced predictive model. On the emotion side, if a robot is trained to avoid touching high temperature object, then when it appears to move away from these hot object, will it be considered as a behaviour of fear or it is just a action based on thier trained lookup table.
The "Chinese room" one is interesting as well. But obviously we cannot rule out every possible scernario but maybe most of them ? given the increased computation power.

SayCan (Berkery),Dalle 2 (OpenAI, text-image generation), PaLm (Google, understand jokes, reasoning) - generative model.

Wonder how machine will learn the common sense e.g the below one.
```
It is not bad at all. Expiry dates are advisory not compulsory, they are for guidance only, not for blind obedience.

Use your common sense, if it smells OK and looks OK then it will likely be OK. If you pick fruit and veg from the garden do they have expiry dates? No. If you catch a fish in the lake or river does it have an expiry date? No.

If it’s OK for fresh foods it’s OK for all foods. Common sense prevails

Assignment. Should plan, schudule and avoid get stuck at all cost. Easter break, next wk is study wk.

We learnt, recall memory by context as well, just like nlp model, or they are designed by us.

Did not realise colab can paste image directly to the markdown cell.

\#recall
Below during the last day of the school.
Strange in uni, never seems to see a proper goodbye durign the last lec, prob online...
```
roses are red
violets are blue,
if this is how the story ends,
then we will be all miss you
```

Monte Carlo is also a city, how many do u want me to see u...

# 17

Intermediant fasting. Eating did slow down the productivity since it is a shift of focus over reconcentration - Acknowledge for what take for granted


# 19

Context learning. Keyword + mindmap - make knowledge map for efficient and effective inforamtion retrival.
\#recall receive offer from another uni while stay in the current uni library feels special.

# 20

We dont take Ls. Yet I am still in my L driving license.
I would say mindmap is a unsupervised learning method.

Revision: Top down revise, then starts practise qs and ask qs.

Outlook is kindof better than gmail in terms of the like button feature and the attachment preview, but gmail do give a better overall ecosystem.

My take on NN way to make a analogy on my learning.
First, I will make mindmap on the highest level i.e heading ~ subheading to get the abstract representation of the lec content.
Then, I will make a copy of that and expand on every point to get a detailed representation.
Next, I will write a essay-format summary to write down my understanding i.e. what I know.
Then, using this summary that collects what I know, I could then find questions on what I dont.
So I will then ask questions on unfamiliar points and record on on a combined pdf.
This provides me with more than one feature representation of each point knowledge I learnt.
Since we learn by context, this method provides more context and allows me to recall each point faster with greater depth.

In short, high level mindmap, low level mindmap, essay form summary, questions & examples, combined pdf.
Extra note, I use the head bar from Chrome to add local file path as url to organise since that folder orientation in Chrome is better than the 
local one as 1. U spcific only the important ones, 2. it gives preview the next folder and u dont have to click in but just hover over.
