Finish listen to Lex with LeCun interview. Learning.

Jeff hinton used to have a title of "engineering fellow" in google. That's all.

Mindmap with different templates - make taking notes, review more interesting and also give the highest efficiency to recall past knowledge 
what not? TOC style of bullets point with indentation, personal experience is less effective compared to mind map, each branch reduce to time taken by a factor of that branch number.

All, if not, most are just feelings of different kinds, so should be all controlable or better take advantage of. Productivity & health here would be the evalution metric.

Knowledge is prob a keyword base mapping, topology (casual relation) over geometric (acutal distance measure) as one says.

- Effort is enough, but sometimes the right window of time is also. E.g. I did the SWOT analysis on the wrong aspect, turns out a similar analysis is published after the tut which help confirms my understanding more.
- change lofi to mind wave song, consistent non-monotonic help aovid shift in focus.
- outside view e.g. nice sun can also be distraction, sometimes, a confined room is a booster for productivity.
- smarter not harder. Tiem out for each task.

Taking note using mindmap is like learning by extract structural repreesntation from the unstructure ones lec slide, recording, etc.

We may be just a more advanced predictive model. On the emotion side, if a robot is trained to avoid touching high temperature object, then when it appears to move away from these hot object, will it be considered as a behaviour of fear or it is just a action based on thier trained lookup table.
The "Chinese room" one is interesting as well. But obviously we cannot rule out every possible scernario but maybe most of them ? given the increased computation power.

SayCan (Berkery),Dalle 2 (OpenAI, text-image generation), PaLm (Google, understand jokes, reasoning) - generative model.

Wonder how machine will learn the common sense e.g the below one.
```
It is not bad at all. Expiry dates are advisory not compulsory, they are for guidance only, not for blind obedience.

Use your common sense, if it smells OK and looks OK then it will likely be OK. If you pick fruit and veg from the garden do they have expiry dates? No. If you catch a fish in the lake or river does it have an expiry date? No.

If it’s OK for fresh foods it’s OK for all foods. Common sense prevails
