My thought on keeping awakeness: body temperature  head in particular, fresh water (image urself as a CPU that needs to be cold down), fresh air : open window and let the breeze in.
So far, keep body temperature bit lower that normal seems to work quite well, my guess is that ur body will do more energy work to generate heat to defense the cold and this chain body chemical reaction happens everywhere includign the brain which makes urself more awake, but the balance is important, too cold for a too while is not good.
