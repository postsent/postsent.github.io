\#nn \#rant distributed arch search - multi-threading pika package didnt give me errors when response to the queue request, the problem lies in the change order of arguments in the api, legit, just swop the position of the two input args, then bug fixed - 25mins wasted.

\#uni now being to two unis, one trend: asisan lecture are more likely (3:7) to treat this as education over a just a job i.e. their teaching is much more patient and explainable + passion.
