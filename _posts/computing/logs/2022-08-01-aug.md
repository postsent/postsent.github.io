# 01
\#nn Realise if use cloud GPU platform, then there is a cycle bin for the deletion of files which will
cause the hard disk filled up quickly if not clean up.
du -sh /root/.local/share/Trash && rm -rf /root/.local/share/Trash   # jupyterlab的回收站

# 02 

\#youtube effecitve engineer - 'swim or sink'

# 03

:"There is only 20 hrs in a day"
:"nah, 20 hrs"

# 06

\#uni lec really feel either a survey paper or a domain specific one.
\#habit see if I can do one thing for a year - run at least 0.5 hr each day regardless any, if injury, still can walk 

# 09

maximise the variance + 2

\#events Google server down today, though its on my end, last for 4mins+???
\#quote "a great mathmatian dont search and build on others solution but rather explore themselves"

# 13

reset 6 - not productive.

# 14

\#nn \#rant distributed arch search - multi-threading pika package didnt give me errors when response to the queue request, the problem lies in the change order of arguments in the api, legit, just swop the position of the two input args, then bug fixed - 25mins wasted.
Not the thrid time - these newly updated apis dont give a f to the old code and no useful warning being given as always, oh, dear, here my time gone again.

# 15

"alright" * 3.
princeton and standford supp notes is like a paper

# 17 

\#musing there are music that u have to settle down to be able to listen.
reset 7 - distracted yesterday.

# 18
run 3 wks in, could run a bit further now without as much break.

# 20

\#neck pain \#back pain ElfAnt Laptop Stand vs Nexstand Laptop Stand

# 21 

AJ loses again, and its a bad ending. Its about how u handle failure not others.
\#study listen to a soft music is such a way to see whether u are settle to study.
\#study search for 1hr ish for 75% keyboard for library environment, then realise then search order on amazon should be:
(its a contrainst satisfaction problem which I should make priority in listing the critia just like greedy search to save more time
when searching the result): 75% > quiet (filtered out mechanic kb) > kb US layout > price > appearance > wireless after these filters are applied, it is then to the common filters e.g. rating, comments on quality, etc.

"I am feel, I am very feel"

# 22

\#study notion is like jira but for personal use not project, jezz recall ppl used to compare it with OneNote & now there is no need for such comparsion anymore, way more advanced.

# 24

\#study \#notion notion is like personal jira project managemet, add priorty field so that I dont freestyle when new tasks come in but rather focus on those that are most time constrainted

\#study shadow boxing ~= shadow studying

# 25

\#coding I am using this open source code and realise the csv file format specific in the readme is different from the one used in which the order of cols are different, 15mins wasted because they forget to update the readme but leave a comment which no warning sign.

# 26

\#uni now being to two unis, one trend: asisan lecture are more likely (3:7) to treat this as education over a just a job i.e. their teaching is much more patient and explainable + passion.

\#study come to library today since w1, will come everyday from now on unless onforseen circumstance happens since it feels weird not to come especially I got the laptop stand which greatly alleviated the neck pain issues as I dont have to stare down up eye level.

\#productivity and I slept for 2hrs + in the afternoon yesterday which slows me down, i sus the indoor small room environment with less fresh air is the cause of my sleepiness.

\#math \#study now i understand how they remember the math symbol name since latex will use it.

\#library hard voyage through tha sleepness period after lunch is so familiar.

dont really understand why i dont enjoy revisit recording - its normal tom miss out important details given a 2hr long lec.

\#study i guess since sometime ago, i start to ask muyself would my time be better spent somewhere else than all in just the coursework content, obviously more time put in better result, but productivity wise and percentage of result yield vs time spend

# 27
\#uni rain, usyd  open day for high school
\#friday not productive again last night, friday night is always the hardest.

rain right after i arrive library, its always about timing.
its strange the place set up a slient zone where there is no door blocking the non slient zone which makes the whole concept meaningless .

: "even if u give up, i I want it to be in library, cuz library is a belif".

# 28

last wednesday, lecturer superisingly decide to do in person lec over zoom , its been so long that I forget the feeling of being a in person lec with many students.

# 29

\#record google map timeline turned on - track all my walk mainly to encourage me more to go to library. so far its ussing 10% battery in background activity, hopefully this is the average.
pretty much all my activity are recorded now and hopefully it add a bit value to my productivity.

\#nn geof hinton mentions in the new course on coursera? with christopher manning that there are two main strems on DL, enginneering vs brain-inspired, but i think to gain a strong foundation on the field, then move to brain-inspired, right, at least know the common math & the coding.

\#reflect its always about trying new things - exploration vs exploitation , i would set the exploration rate to 25% now compard to before <10%.
strange that forget if the internet can lead to distraction then its "magic" can also give more focus with its connection based online community

\#uni degree-wise, nothing luckier than first choosing cs then ai major, ai concept resonate with real life & productivity so much, e.g. adversarial training - white box and black is like me adversarial against myself & my peers / the past 

\#onenote dont like the idea of onenote allows date modification - all my notes now lose the reliabilty of being old  

# 30 

\#uni \#school \#study uni is just an extension around the lirary. Library checked. #TODO - unlock more library if time.

never have a good stomach time after drinking coffee :(

\#uni 4/10 - no more.

\#library my god - so many students in the fisher library, remembers me of those days the wk before final in unsw main library, students everywhere.

\#uni see these kids visiting uni just hit differently when recall my old days.

\# just move from one library to another, the sec I come out and sit outside the another lib, the air has neve been so refreshing, great weather too, jezz.
