# 01

First day of Oct, marked.
work on what is solvable, those cannot, whatever how worry wont anyway, just break it down into small and "line them up, knock them down".

# 04 

didnt thought i can put the mode i used for running to studying, guess library servrs as the strongerst regularised term.
\#recall not much memory back then but do remember in year 3 , with peers, having this feeling of every sec matter, where i miss e.g. 30mins, would like eat and shower quicker to compensate the time.

# 05

\#daily wake up early always feel better than late - dont go gentle into that good morning.
\#daily from now on, heathly drinks only, no sugar as the default setting as it looks like it may slow our brain down when digest them.

\#research now, do see that enginnering is more like try whatever to make it work while science is to observation and formulate and derive result accordingly.
\#study now writing seems to be a norm, a library space, a light music, takes fresh air every hr, writing done.

\#internet btw, overleaf detect correctly on which uni I am from thou I use a different email, hmm, either google expose it or overleaf did sth e.g. based on the ip, hope its the later.

# 06
