\#quote the difference between machine learning engineer and scientists is whether understand theories like VC dimension.

\#morning the network speed is much better in the morning than night since ppl

\#passion should surround urself with likeminded ppl, doesnt really matter which field is in - rethink about this after getting a haircut from someone, dont why but just feel the level of passion and dedication he put into his work - which I absolute reasonate about, just like what CR7 said:
"doesnt matter what u do - be the top .. 1"
