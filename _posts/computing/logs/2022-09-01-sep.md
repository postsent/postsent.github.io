# 01
\#Sep new month - hmm.

\#coffee flat white taste not good than mocha - checked

\#productivity reason why I did not use notion until recently is that I used to thought notion is still "small" and thus is not reliable from a computer science standpoitns but damn time flies, should I realise the usefullness and the huge improvement since 2 years ago from notion.

\#ppl kobe: "4:30 am wake, 3~4 hrs sleep..."

\#study going library helps avoid myself think about life too much

\#uni hmm, see 20+ students storm & protest in a building where a event is hold.

\#uni find a place where i could stand & is also slient space. after 1 whole semester.

\#research see one of the prof's paper being rejected during searching relevant paper in my current research, lmao.

# 3

\#ppl jamine foxx - impersonate, song
\#study reset9

with youtube and MOCC, the educaion seems to have great modularity - just a matter of oen or more youtube videos fro unsure concept / topic

\#usyd sat, 9am, bell ring from the quadrangle
\#productity my thought now change from self-supervise to create / find a env that allows such automation of productivity that no need to think about how to control, once get into the env, its all execution.

\#quote "u happy is ok"

\#quote 
lecture: "do u have any questiosn?"
we: silent
he: "well this could be difficult then"

\#ai stable diffusion , Colorado State Fairâ€™s annual art competition

\#recall \#study its been a long time I havent eat while studying, no moti for that recently ..
\#uni \#library one side effect of going to library is that, from my "years of experience (since y12)" it makes u less want to study at home due to the reliance of "crowdsourcing env"
\#quote the difference between machine learning engineer and scientists is whether understand theories like VC dimension.

\#morning the network speed is much better in the morning than night since ppl

# 6

\#passion should surround urself with likeminded ppl, doesnt really matter which field is in - rethink about this after getting a haircut from someone, dont why but just feel the level of passion and dedication he put into his work - which I absolute reasonate about, just like what CR7 said:
"doesnt matter what u do - be the top .. 1"

\#run \#think used to thought do late night run could bring me more thinking by seeing these ppl doing things at night and reflect on myself, then I found that doing exercise while thinking doesnt really work, its much better just via communication or stationary observation to reflect on observed phenomeno.

\#hobby when i have some slack time, could collect 1) nice walkpaper in particular, abstract style ones. 2) music for exercise & study 3) quotes 4) interview

# 7 

\#company do find to have a better understanding about a company or anything, just follow the twitter account for e.g half year then its seem the picture is clear  
\#uni to understand a uni better, for student life, check out the studen club and soc, for studying, check out library 6am , 12pm and during the peak.
\# plan + execution mode

\#coding after 1 year, relative import f me again

# 8

\#study music & study 
\#uni this postgraduate coursework only study space now really feels like sth - a small community
\#usyd can see usyd is trying well at least sth to improve things, not sure if unsw is doing sth similar, e.g. career workshop & more, survey on different things, thou i thing i complaint is that at unsw, i will never imagine to see ppls not from uni to go there to take photos, at usyd that main building - gez, feel like a tourist attraction every time walk pass - like a dream - now really would regret if not come here to study 

\#life "there is no right or wrong path, only those u walk and others walk".

\#library every time when I see someone still stay at the libary place where i sit around, i think about kobe where he mentioned that there is once a player come later in the same traing gym he is in, he notice it, and when he left for break, he is there, when that player come back, he is still there, after he left, he is still there.


# 9

\#event the queen pass away - end of an era. somewhat sad that everything afterward is so well prepare.

\#quote "dont think just do" - topgun - library

\#study the cringest moment i saw on the discord online study room is two A levels students recognise each other and start to waive to each other across the screen - just saying.

\#twice as one wise irish man once said "I come here not to take part, but to take over"

sometimes realsie if the lecturer did not put enough content on the slides then it will consider  as not self contained but if he put too many then it will be reading the slides only teaching stuyle.

\#school I somewhat do forget what is it like to write on physcial paper - but result is more important not how paper gives feels

\#rant I though the whole point of recording / online learning is to avoid Mr PPT.

\#quote dont ermembe which interview but jobs thoughts on gaming, the first sentence he said is "its a good industry" well, thats say a lot on its own.

\#rant all these so inefficient, the whole thing is just they brag about theirselves, nothing informative, little time being given to ask qs, what a let down, but expected, its is what it is, just formatism, would just feel like a waste if i would be at that posistion doing those as daily work at that age.

\#rant Funding is responsibility not something to be bragged about, the money is from government which is from tax which is from genearl public. oh, lord, I am more a heart and soul person.

\# its always about ppl, and takes inspriation from them - hope I will not miss a single library day from now on, oh, the old days where library is about uni about.

# 10

the great hall the building lower the flag as well as the left side 3 flags area

# 11 

\#events opera house had the queen photo on to commemorate; didnt go - 4 assignments due next wk.

\#quote charlie munger' talk on envy, greed.

\#mistake for the first 3 wks - i home cook all the studies and run at night for 8km as i thought this is the optimal, but it turns out i could do on campus, since the campus is big, i still get about 6k by walk around for lunch & switch library, and the best part is, it feels much better... strange.

# 12

\#event a public holiday day is made to commerate the queen 9.22
