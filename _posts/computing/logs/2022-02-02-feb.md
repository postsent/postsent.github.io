AMD has compatiable issue with win11 , nice.
There is something special abotu the server in singapore, not sure what.
Chrome is like a beast in terms of customerisation

Singapore air has very very nice customer service if register as member - they call me back to give me additional helpful info thou I am not asking.

LenovoVantageService use quite some ram

Find a balance between get the job done first and clean up.

pip uninstall my cuda compatiable torchvision, and OS error makes the compatible install of another version.
At the end, i have to reinstall it......
add explicitly -I to ignore installed

Clear up Onenote space, backup UNSW old study notes and delete to save space in onedrive for USYD.

NYU DL course, has a reddit forum and a discord for chatting, 21 century init.

The github repo uses Jekyll, let's goooooo.

\#twice use git len just to see how bad my commit is.

deep dream generator - really nice.
Note that the style image and the base one, to produce the best possible outcome, the content needs to be matched based on my experiment.
E.g. I choose a ink-painting style, with a base image that contains: sky, ocean, ppl, bridge. The style that also content these similar content provides the best transformation which makes sense since similar object's style transfer is better than different objects.

Meet old friends and make new. See real ppl.

A real paper calendar has the advantage of looking ahead the schdule by a lot, google calendar on the otherhand, is more suitable for detailed weekly plan , thou the google task is helpful too, but cannot look ahead for important event that is day based and not time based.

Google task + calendar : yess, pls

Two zoom account similar to google, one casual one formal.

Love weave highlighter.

socket can be connected to another one as long as the totla wat output is within the threhold.

calligraph holds more weight especially when I read more on screen, time new romen is just better than arial.

backup onenote, then see how onenote is stored, with toc & files for each section, noice.

realise zoom allows distribute sound based on different device, accidentally connect two video output and find this out where zoom automatically select the second spare output and i have two sound output at the same time.

Be proactive - very important.

Onenote on win11 has improved so much compared to win10, 2020 version.
E.g. indention now support 3 level over the old 2. And a wayy better navigation panel.
In-page sticky note for TOC may be a useful updates in backlog.

VR is just a new domain where everything is possible, virtual shopping, roller coaster, still more insterested in AI in robotics thou. Looking back, iron man is like a dream. 

Wait for ios15.4 maskid so badly.

Wtf, usyd does not have a computer vision course with course code: COMP, only one for AMME degree...
And UNSW does not have NLP course...

\#recall
Sylvia plath - that poem make sense.

Being asked to be self-contain in the math report, now make sense when I write the jupyte book page - a collection / dictionary / easy indexed learnt knowledge.

plug and play CPU / GPU on laptop, ecpu/gpu, or modular laptop sounds really nice.

Rain, rain, rain... rain does not like australia feb,

No point for me to read so much without collecting some great phrases so just do it..

\#eyes That idea of "edge of blur" is really making sense.

\#watch Yann LeCun: Dark Matter of Intelligence and Self-Supervised Learning | Lex Fridman Podcast #258
self-supervised learning: e.g. give machine a video and ask it to predict the next e.g. frames in high-dimension continous space.
self-supervised learning: fill in the blank: successful in nlp,cut off some words & ask the model to predict.
"For traditional ML, use distribution to represent uncertainty. However, 
Right now, use giant distribution to represent every words e.g. similarity.
Problem: how to find a more compress way to represent these.
"It just stats but intelligence"
: at some level, its possible intelligence is just stats.
what kind of stats?
the model of our world has some causality. By observation and others.

POV:
at high level, it looks like intelligence.
At low level, it may be low level.
Computational neuron scientist, "everything is about prediction". self-supervised learning is trying reproducing.

How to reproduce learn world model e.g. same as cat which has 800 neurons-ish.
1. Make machine represent the world.
2. Reasoning based on observation. (build upon the existing background knowledge)
3. make action plan
predictive model to predict the complex real world, people behaviour, phyics, branch in the tree, water.

Sounds like AI is still just started.

Having a bigger monitor just gives so much more postive impact on my workflow. 
Goint to library at this point seems to be less productive due to the lack in facilities.

\#recall Learn how to learn and i will never ask.

settle down and reading just make sense

Just have a typing speed test, got 61 wpm with 93 % accuracy which is pretty bad though I am better but realise the way I type need to change in order to improve.
