Downloaded forest app since find a bit less productive yesterday and the day before.

Maximise the variance in doing course.

Make a cheatsheet - two pages summary of one lec content, A3 landscape, much better for a quick overview.

Just realise stephen hawking in one interview mentions that AI could be the most concern in the future and it is very achievable.

\#rant really dislike the uni at the first place, did not put all the needed contact info properly, and after the email is sent, it replies that to sent to somewhere else instead, after a few days waiting, like, why would'nt they just forware it instead, dont know where all the tutitino fee goes.

Feel like for those elite, it will be like wolf in sheeps, "it just one mark", "where I am from one mark will set apart 1k students apart. for just high school entrance exam"

Before when I feel p off, i run, now prob read some papers.

# 10

\#idk
Find out have not back pain but something similarly that I couldnt sit long, so decide stop going to library, suprised no places to stand in any sections of the library.
Stand atm at home and join the study together discord, lets go, continue -> focus.

AWS is great for making the deepracer, unfortunity it seems like I may not participate into it as I wanted to.

Its never a competition if u enjoy it, I suppose.

# 11 

Fun just retaught ethic yesterday, and today and tomorrow will be teacher strike. It makes sense from either pespective, so, hmm.

Okï¼Œ just get more interested in how we acutally understand things, what is our knowledge base, how the brain store,encode and decode, selectively, how can we model it, how can we reproduce it?

\#musing What is my reserch interest? what may wakes me up in the morning, meditate before/during bed?

# 12

\#research Reading more papers - aovid reinventing the wheel.

I would say thou, one reason why last year is not ideal is that the environment, did not expecting the lightness etc of the room will affect my vision so much which then
affect my productivity in the long run.

Past the scheduled plan a bit, guess just skip dinner and count it as a fasting night.

\# google back on the google glass, and better.
Ecosystem is prob gonna make better

# 13

Sad to see a univeristy post ads to get more students in a way, it makes sense, but just feel a bit different. Guess in reality, everything is a industry. Money.

\#uni join class from different TA will learnt from different perspective.
Strange students from my places organise online study group with zoom... compared to 24/7 easy in & out discord, it strange that no access to discord,
who know and it also already being duplicate there.. hmm.

\#rant There is always one course that just dont give u much examples and expect u to google search, I mean, we pay this amount of tuitution fee, if just learn by random google search,
why join ur course? smh.

\#uni usyd that engineering email sent out events but never reply query, weird.

# 14

Strange, first time the colab foul on me and did not save the work I done late last night, it was shown on the revision history bu not on the actual notebook, hmm.
\#lesson save ur work to github once done.

\#plan Current plan is library weekend, home weekdays.
