Hi, first day of day, almost half way thruogh the year.
Downloaded forest app since find a bit less productive yesterday and the day before.

# 02

Maximise the variance in doing course.

Make a cheatsheet - two pages summary of one lec content, A3 landscape, much better for a quick overview.

Just realise stephen hawking in one interview mentions that AI could be the most concern in the future and it is very achievable.

Be jealous that the kids have game that help them learn e.g. RL.

# 09

\#rant really dislike the uni at the first place, did not put all the needed contact info properly, and after the email is sent, it replies that to sent to somewhere else instead, after a few days waiting, like, why would'nt they just forware it instead, dont know where all the tutitino fee goes.

Feel like for those elite, it will be like wolf in sheeps, "it just one mark", "where I am from one mark will set apart 1k students apart. for just high school entrance exam"

Before when I feel p off, i run, now prob read some papers.

# 10

\#idk
Find out have not back pain but something similarly that I couldnt sit long, so decide stop going to library, suprised no places to stand in any sections of the library.
Stand atm at home and join the study together discord, lets go, continue -> focus.

AWS is great for making the deepracer, unfortunity it seems like I may not participate into it as I wanted to.

Its never a competition if u enjoy it, I suppose.

# 11 

Fun just retaught ethic yesterday, and today and tomorrow will be teacher strike. It makes sense from either pespective, so, hmm.

Ok， just get more interested in how we acutally understand things, what is our knowledge base, how the brain store,encode and decode, selectively, how can we model it, how can we reproduce it?

\#musing What is my reserch interest? what may wakes me up in the morning, meditate before/during bed?

# 12

\#research Reading more papers - aovid reinventing the wheel.

I would say thou, one reason why last year is not ideal is that the environment, did not expecting the lightness etc of the room will affect my vision so much which then
affect my productivity in the long run.

Past the scheduled plan a bit, guess just skip dinner and count it as a fasting night.

\# google back on the google glass, and better.
Ecosystem is prob gonna make better

# 13

Sad to see a univeristy post ads to get more students in a way, it makes sense, but just feel a bit different. Guess in reality, everything is a industry. Money.

\#uni join class from different TA will learnt from different perspective.
Strange students from my places organise online study group with zoom... compared to 24/7 easy in & out discord, it strange that no access to discord,
who know and it also already being duplicate there.. hmm.

\#rant There is always one course that just dont give u much examples and expect u to google search, I mean, we pay this amount of tuitution fee, if just learn by random google search,
why join ur course? smh.

\#uni usyd that engineering email sent out events but never reply query, weird.

# 14

Strange, first time the colab foul on me and did not save the work I done late last night, it was shown on the revision history bu not on the actual notebook, hmm.
\#lesson save ur work to github once done.

\#plan Current plan is library weekend, home weekdays.

Realies that I am pretty bad at debugging sometimes, easy to stuck, did not catch the keyword when try googling.

After 2019, now still on my L, learner liscence.

# 15

Library the whole day yesterday, the joint part of the back starts feel a bit different and so prob stand today at home.

\#thanks really apperciate all article that highlights and begin with an tl:dr intro - it helps everyone.

\#fun
I would call a online study group with urself only is: self-supervised learning, with peers is semi, with teacher is supervised, with sibilings is adversarial, 
with a computer avatar is RL, without any is unsupervised.

Sometimes listen music while studying is not bad in the sense that u can discover new sound.

# 16 

Chrom extension: new tab studio - can add countdown so good enough.

recently dont really like ms product, word docs and excel can not open file...

\#blog
https://lilianweng.github.io/faq/
Q: How can you keep up blogging?
A: "Pain is inevitable but suffering is optional" --- this is the first sentence of Haruki Murakami's book "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running". I love that book. His altitude towards running is pretty much aligned with how I feel about maintaining this blog.

Do like the idea of dont reinventing the wheel but sometimes the just feel like it more like a summary of others work thou it still make sense.
Our brain only has one head, cannot compete with transformer
万卷书 vs 万里路， theory vs practise

Scitech library - checked.

\#class when caren talked about sentiment anlaysis she mentioend scott morsion and what if he want to learn chinese in china, and then a student said he is not welcome, we laughed pretty hard.

would it be strange that I understand more about why we read...

\#recall during covid, when studied at unsw, its about law library, the quad, centenenial park, pretty much thats all since the main library is semi-closed.

That time when ran at night, the whole park, almost no noe but a couple of friends in the middle of the park near the lake where the was no light but laugter and laugher.

A lot of time, actually, just switch a new positino would give more movtiation to sturdy over slack over phone.

waterloo refers to Napoleon/滑铁卢。。。

work health balance is def a lot harder, sometimes, when interersted, it is addicitive to , study. or rather depends on how u define the word "study"

\#study
irrefular schedule activity that is followed loosely is bad for productivity.

almost like I try to forget about it, but prob should write a log abotu the graudation ceremony 5.4.

\#class I do experienced lecuterer will ask the students in the first class that what do they want to take away from the course.

it such a strong advererisal effect to study with higher focus when surround with irrelevant noise.

# 17 

For the very first time after maybe 2 years+, sleep 9 : 30 hrs yesterday, jess, felt different.

\#idea IF we can create a model that properly convert text to video, then wouldnt we be able to translate every literature into a short film.

# 19

\#paper how to do research at MIT AI Lab

# 20

\#rant My window machine restarts without any notice when I plug in the power cable in front of me, the single worse OS ever, even worse than template OS which at least has some dignity.
User who dont buy the pro OS dont even have control on basic functions like when to allow updates. No wonder MS are losing in the AI side, too much focus on the marketing and how to sequeese customer profit over 
the inititative of a technology compabny which is to develop customer centric / friendly product instead of money focus. Since these constant updates, would obviously provide them with massive users to test out their new features that cannot be covered in their testing process. THEY DONT CARE. If still like this, who knows, may be they are the next nokia.
