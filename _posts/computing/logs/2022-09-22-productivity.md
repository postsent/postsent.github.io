2022.9.22 not being productive recently so try to figure it out why and give myself some solutions.
First sus is that I feel like these isnt much point to the meaning part, so I provide myself some problems that may wake me up in the morning and sleep early.

# Big Questions

Below are some questions that i may think about for the rest of my life so that i always have something in mind and to chase for when I feel nothing in mind or there arent any that is important.

## VR bird vision

VR with controlable bionic bird that provide feedback in form of vision and sound + tactile feedback.

**Motivation**: How do other animals live? a day in life as a animal.

Use graph / GNN as a base, different human senses as node e.g. cv, nlp, logical reasoning, could add prior knowledge with bayesian inference to model brain.

**Motivation**: AGI.
