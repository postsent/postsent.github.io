Finished NLP assignment 2 with teammate, collobration as always been a bless.
Focus on revision now.
Library sitting is not so comfit so decide just revise at home.

\#uni \#rant I received a spam mail from another language organisation saying how it could help with my final exam, very annoying.
Its just strange that no one penalise these org and just let flood of spams in.

Apple ios sleep feature - very nice.
