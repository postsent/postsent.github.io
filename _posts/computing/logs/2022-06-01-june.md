# 01

Finished NLP assignment 2 with teammate, collobration as always been a bless.
Focus on revision now.
Library sitting is not so comfit so decide just revise at home.

\#uni \#rant I received a spam mail from another language organisation saying how it could help with my final exam, very annoying.
Its just strange that no one penalise these org and just let flood of spams in.

Apple ios sleep feature - very nice.

Listen halfway the robo brain chat with Geoff hinton last night before bed, brain and NN, will listen to all his interview if the questions and follow ups are all at this level.Powertoy, pin toy feature, very nice.

\#unsw Now, looking at, the 1 year VIP project course in which little guidance is given, is really like a self exploring journey. Thou the outcome is not ideal, it does give me a sense on what I can do without basically much support from others. The frustration seems to be a norm after seeing how many other experience much of of it at different levels.
Salt and pepper, its part of the ingradient even thou it may not taste good depends on my weather.

Every time see plog remains me of prolog - not really a good days.

\#study Sometimes will have this oppositve force - like I study because I am genuniely interested the course or I find it simply makes sense and is part of the must do or I just respect the effort behind all the learning material provided, not because the marks, the ranking, looks good on resume ya di ya di ya. It is just binary, whether subjectively or objectively that subject of matter would shape me towards a better direction.

I did not realise those complains on office setting e.g. neck pain will also happen to me, review some better position when study. This somewhat forces me out of library

\#observe
Andrew Ng explained a bit about how interest rate in bank could lead to more focus in short term investment and how this short term fav investment affect the IT industry particular on those research that do not yield quickly and suggestions by him on how should these research changes their description on funding grant to hightlights their short term imporantance as well. High interest rate means the money in the future would worth less since money in bank can generate more money in the future, which makes the money in the future less worthy, and then short term investment is more prefered. This call of increasing the interest rate is by the US Top bank assoicate to reduce the inflation rate that is currently at all time high and this decision make the share market especially the IT ones look very bad, take Facebook as an example.

Hmm, I think it is harder to balance workload and health compared to purely focusing on workload and so I will give it try for a healthier lifestyle with stress-less focus

Sometimes, I am thinking why we innovate, and feel like that is partly because we forget about things, and then pick it up with a new perspective, if we have all the answer in mind, it will definitely be hard to generate new angle when looking at things.

# 05

\#mark here: If there is one day missing in the log, its either I am very productive or not so, so I better just log at least one line to summarise each day.
How can we encode our knowledge if imagine it is a vector space? Memorise by understanding for revision.

"Life is too short to be mean to each other"

why not over why is always a good start.

\#sigh If Isaac Newton can do it without computer, no excues for us whatsoever.

\#observe Havard release their professor salary, ofc, the HBS professor comes 1st.

# 06 

1/4 - one final done - a theory based one, pretty much memorise by understand everything then done.

Strange that did not get suggestion to learn a network by drawing the architecture from begining, did it for lstm, much confident to say
I understand lstm at some level now.
