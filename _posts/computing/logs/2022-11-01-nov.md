\#log the more I categorise these writing, the more  I realise I start to summarise different aspect of life... or as one said, "connect the dots backward".
\#study revision mode is like hibernation - nothing else but one thing wise.

enginneering all the way til it works - solution just a matter of mind will.
music, quote, sleep, shower, exercise, food, drink, at least one would work at a given time.
