# 1 

\#uni well, there brought some sheeps to A10, for one moment I thought I heard it wrong, lmao.

# 2 

\#study zotero just a overall much better resource management system i.e. meta file system with tags enable - easily organise hundreds of documents than the normal plain file system 

\#productivity reset everyday seems to be a good choice to improve productivity by not conditional independent to the past and future i.e. a countdown of 1 day instead of e.g. a wk span which makes the goal stretch across longer period that makes things seem more unreachable in a short time that discourages high motivation in finishing the task since it cannot be done in one wheras one day countdown reduce tasks into one day finishable ones and thus more moti to get it done on time.

\#timezone prob should wake up early to catch the other side of the timezone.

\#study Schrödinger's cat - when observe change, if not observe, never know. big beliver in this.

# 3 

\#tuning seems like feeling that incurred by habit i.e. periodical, is different to direct feelings, need some other treatment to address it.   

\#event neurips seem like have many ppl on, if know beforehand, should have try: pay and attend virtually.

\#usyd host.co has quite some venues with events e.g. wedding ; saw carriage with two white horses today.

\#reset factors analysed: 0.3music + 

\#joke ice cold -

: "whats in the ocean"
: "fish"
: "what do fish do when they breathe?"
: "make bubbles"
: "what is that sound"
: "blue blue blue"

\#daily youtube has great if nto the best comments section. Twitter, on the other hand, just wayyy more toxic.

\#event try chatGPT yesterday, like others said, can smell the melting of GPUs.
\#study this ranking is really pushy... back to grinding

\#event "If something is free, you are the product"

\#study well, I guess the answer is simly read more and make organised, grouped notes

\#tools adobe pro pc - really powerful in dealing with pdfs, prob should keep up with version.

\#library oh, lord, she coughed for 2hrs in a <10 ppl library.

\#events all three are there at the neuroips, regret * 100

# 06

\#music \#recall affection from long term short term memory. Xianjian3 song, speechless.

\#events before, my perception about government page and service is more too long didnt bother, seems like after covid, these services have improved a ton.

# 07

\#uni whole study space is mine now. Believe the construction comes early than I do and it prob is loud, sometimes its about come at the right time.

\#uni to relatively chill to get good mark - good TA, project based course, and luck of choosing the course.
\#uni there is free mask on the front desk, forget about it for 2 semesters... 

\#project communication is important * 2 - rather annoyed by new msg than errors caused by misunderstanding due to lack in communication.

\#uni well , during the break, the school made massive maintaince service on hardware etc. The montiors are updated in the library w/ the classic dell 19inch one. AND it can be extended via USB-C. The only catch is that the study space I often go to, there is a CCTV right behind the monitor, so not so interested. but at least the money is will spent.

\#study well, time.
\#user \#study-group a posterior
\#mark Eddie Hall 500kg deadlift

# 09

\#study oh, some interm old gp ppl are back, but stick with the og for now.
\#daily Rule: Schrödinger's cat - if thinking cannot resolve the anything, dont bother.
\#reset if not reset e.g. daily, then may accumulate too many things e.g. "emotional damage", reset basically clean up the cache and put more weight to forward learning only over backprop with unneccesary experience replay
