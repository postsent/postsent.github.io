\#uni well, there brought some sheeps to A10, for one moment I thought I heard it wrong, lmao.

# 2 

\#study zotero just a overall much better resource management system i.e. meta file system with tags enable - easily organise hundreds of documents than the normal plain file system 

\#productivity reset everyday seems to be a good choice to improve productivity by not conditional independent to the past and future i.e. a countdown of 1 day instead of e.g. a wk span which makes the goal stretch across longer period that makes things seem more unreachable in a short time that discourages high motivation in finishing the task since it cannot be done in one wheras one day countdown reduce tasks into one day finishable ones and thus more moti to get it done on time.

\#timezone prob should wake up early to catch the other side of the timezone.

\#study Schrödinger's cat - when observe change, if not observe, never know. big beliver in this.

# 3 

\#tuning seems like feeling that incurred by habit i.e. periodical, is different to direct feelings, need some other treatment to address it.

\#daily youtube has great if nto the best comments section. Twitter, on the other hand, just wayyy more toxic.

\#event try chatGPT yesterday, like others said, can smell the melting of GPUs.
\#study this ranking is really pushy... back to grinding

\#study well, I guess the answer is simly read more and make organised, grouped notes

\#uni to relatively chill to get good mark - good TA, project based course, and luck of choosing the course.
\#uni there is free mask on the front desk, forget about it for 2 semesters... 

\#project communication is important * 2 - rather annoyed by new msg than errors caused by misunderstanding due to lack in communication.

\#uni well , during the break, the school made massive maintaince service on hardware etc. The montiors are updated in the library w/ the classic dell 19inch one. AND it can be extended via USB-C. The only catch is that the study space I often go to, there is a CCTV right behind the monitor, so not so interested. but at least the money is will spent.

\#daily Rule: Schrödinger's cat - if thinking cannot resolve the anything, dont bother.
