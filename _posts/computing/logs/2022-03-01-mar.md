Google improves its pdf viewer.
That chinese delivery does not even have the functionality to give tips to the delivery driver....

With a better monitor, see how chrome group tab feature works like a charm.


# 03

CMU - dataLab

# 04
Microsoft Onenote in app full screen - long waited feature hope others e.g. chrome follows too.

The weather in sydney appears to be very odd, rain since the first week of school until now the alomist the end of the second. And it is forcasted to continue to next week... British

# 05

So far the plan is :
- word for lec notes since long
- mindmaster / mindmap for paper reading since the length is medium. 10 pages e.g.
- onenote highlighting : one page length reading material

In short, the note taking apps chosen it depends on depth of understanding required for the reading.

Mindmap prob just useful for overview and brainstorming

microsoft edge has a better pdf anotation section but adobe has a better viewing, e.g. can view a comment in full details rather cap at certain word length

# 07

\#recall two students in the tut having their laptop fan running like a jet setting in front, what a moment.

the pop up window aftertaking a screenshot on win10 used to have an indicator of closing with a symbol of right arrow instead of the current x, back then it looks really unintiutive.

I dont give a sleep.

\#rant cannot believe USYD students dont have proper access to MS Team, 0 clue what they use for team communication, canvas integration with word doc is just disaster. Strange. from UNSW, MS Team is just make sense.

why women have: Ms, Miss, Mrs whereas man is just Mr?

Somewhat strange to read a blog that describes a technology that exists today from the past.  

# 09

Currently workflow does not suit library well, home rather much efficient.

understand over just making good notes - note taking should be fast.

# 10

Fina **mindmap** is really suitable for giving a high level abstraction of the content, but adding too many details would ruin. Its also a nice way to preview a new content.

Taking notes to focus on lecture and understand the content over just copy and paste.

never have receive ads from UNSW student society, in USYD, however, the whatever so called USU sent a ads that is paid to the USU, not good.

Used to preview lecture content early on, but then looking back, lose focus during the lec thought I knew everything already, now, I just use mindmap for the overview, leaves some freshes so to be more focus.

\#recall putin once said: "There is no happiness in life"

Everything can be trained, every observation could be training instance and if treat ourselve as a model, then we should 
generalise everything.

Stress cotroling is a skill.

# 13
window OS : a lots of subtle annoying features: exclude microsoft edge from alt + tab.

# 14

mindmap should stay in high level with minimal details. A following up e.g. word doc should supplement the remaining details over cramp everything into one.

Its somewhat quite strange, word doc does not by default support OCR but OneNote does and it makes search through Notes a ton better.

Realise how much a impact of poor instruction could lead to, e.g. a template provided by the school itself is incorrect, and after following it, it does not align with the marking citeria, which is due to a lack in update with the relevant section. Should always check the validity of a ED forum post, what they said may always change.

Reaslise THE provides great info on education , only important info was sent so far, no ads or stuffs as such!

\#writing topic sentence if uses others idea then reference, explanation part normally DIY.

Google scholar has a better search engine for the obvious reason compared to the uni library.

# 17

Wonder one day we can spawn mutli-processes like computer, like spawn a robot and tell it what it should do, then focus on another class, just stay at high level.

\#medicine if need a more gentle medicine/mouth wash, go for those that kids can use as well, e.g. in the mouth wash case, kids one guarantee no alchol

Feel like AI summary and make notes is of great help, what we are doing cn definitely be automated with much higher efficency

Set up task allocation in calendar helps with measuring ur efficiency and then improve accordingly

sigma rules series on youtube pretty nice the comment section

name important files with a prefix begin with A or just make a dedicated folder for it.


adobe is pwoerful in terms of supporting comprehensive tools wherea MS edge is better for quick annotation. So the default is MS edge but use adobe pro when necessary.
regular backup on the important stuffs are crucial if not use cloud, unless making big asusmption here.

AI remix pls.

some top mindmap app surprisingly come from my home city, lovely

Do enjoy those lecture starts with the slides of objective 

\#what??? Trimester in UNSW has 10 wks initially,then they introduce w5 as study wk with no lecs, semester has 13 wks, I thought it includes the study wk but it dont.
In short, trimester has 9 wks for content whereas semester has 13wk... 4 more wks... about 50%...

Still like the inventor of Python, after retired said retiring is too boring and so go to big 4 to work again.

# 21

My thought on keeping awakeness: body temperature  head in particular, fresh water (image urself as a CPU that needs to be cold down), fresh air : open window and let the breeze in.
So far, keep body temperature bit lower that normal seems to work quite well, my guess is that ur body will do more energy work to generate heat to defense the cold and this chain body chemical reaction happens everywhere includign the brain which makes urself more awake, but the balance is important, too cold for a too while is not good.

Never see a lecturer like this before, change the lecture time on the day with no reasoning... Feel like because it is a course mainly for international students or rather china, ppl just less care since no much complaints. Or this is normal in USYD?

# 24

Looks like music in mind, library everywhere. Shift of focus or rather distraction.
"Rather asking what you dont know, write down what u do and learn based on that"
OneNote for summary, pdf annotation aggregation is not suitable in onenote thou.

Information aggregation.
"cannot connect the dot looking forware backward yes

race against time.

Onenote dont have in page TOC, but guess the toggle hidden may work similarly.

try install pyspark on window, failed.
success in install it on wsl2
side effect, need to spend to time to configure the jupyter & its extension again for wsl2.
Benefit: install process is lot inituitvie.

\#observation
MS Edge when copy the link, it gives a alias when useful info over a long pain raw url chrome did that being say it depends on the user case. Also, did not check if chrome has similar, but I made this feature default in edge.

Lifelong notebook sounds good. How to properly use tool to accumulate knowledge learnt, looks like uni havent put much emphasis on it.

He said "he is here to impress no one but himself..."

\#recall I think roughly one week later I sent to UNSW that the testamur has a mistake on the specialisation, I got them correctly quite soon given I realised it so late and that it is already declared on the myEquals service. Thanks UNSW :) This really scare me off a bit consider getting a general CS degree without any specialisation after doing quite some AI courses think just one electives is not out of 6.

# 2022-04-01

So far, enjoy this transfer from UNSW to USYD, I would call this contrastive learning. No comfort zone pls.
