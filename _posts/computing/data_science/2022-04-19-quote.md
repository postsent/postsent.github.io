metric spaces, and then incrementally learning complex geometric transformations
that map one space to another. All you need are spaces of sufficiently high dimension-
ality in order to capture the full scope of the relationships found in the original data.
The whole process hinges on a single core idea: that meaning is derived from the pair-
