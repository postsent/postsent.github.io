We can see that the stop words list above contains some words that could be important in some contexts. These could be words like **i, not, between, because, won, against**. You might need to customize the stop words list for some applications. 

For the punctuation, we saw earlier that **certain groupings** like **':)'** and **'...'** should be retained when dealing with tweets because they are used to express emotions. In other contexts, like medical analysis, these should also be removed.
