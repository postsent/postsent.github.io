excerpt: My view on studying from a perspective of a ML model
---

ML model learning is similar to how we learn.

# Regularisation, penality term 
Being Regularised / penalised if get distracted.

# Learning curve

We should also keep e.g. diary on the mistakes made to avoid making the same, start from a weaker learner and grow.

Osillation in learning similar to real life.. but overall should maintain the trend of making less mistakes.

# Generalisation

# Types of learning

Supervised learning ~= Uni/Library  
Semi-supervised learning ~= Student Apartment/Roommate  
Unsupervised learning ~= Self  

#TODO
